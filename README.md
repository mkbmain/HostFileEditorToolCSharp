# HostFileEditorToolCSharp


Made this for some one as a example of a C sharp windows form tool which was releated with what they where trying to achive. will edit host dns on a system allowing basic crud operations ..  ( this will need to run as admin and is configured to request so but does make debugging hard i suggest to chage the app config to a copy of host file stored in a non protected area when debugging and testing this is often suggested)
